        h2 ðŸ¤” Questions?
        h3 Why did you make this?
        p 
          | Hacker News is a wonderful source of information which continues to inspire me to explore and learn. 
          | Given tons of posts are created everyday, sometimes it could be difficult to keep up with stories that Iâ€™m interested in. 
          | Wouldnâ€™t it be great to be able to collect and digest stories regularly based on my own interests?
        h3 How does it identify stories based on topics?
        p.
          We simply use provided topics as keywords to #[a(href=searchUrl) search] through HN stories and comments. The search is powered by Algolia which usually delivers good results.
        h3 Is there a list of topics possible or can I input anything?
        p Feel free to input anything you want. However, for the best result, itâ€™s recommended to use keywords that show up frequently in HN titles. 
        h3 How often do I receive newsletters?
        p.
         Newsletters are sent out at 15:00 #[a(href="https://time.is/UTC", target="_blank") UTC] every Friday.
        h3 More questions?
        p.
